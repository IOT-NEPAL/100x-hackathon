## 🐛 BUGS FOUND & FIXED

### **CRITICAL BUGS (FIXED):**

#### 1. ✅ Missing `$job_offers` Variable in user-dashboard.php
**Issue:** Line 143 referenced undefined `$job_offers` variable causing PHP errors  
**Impact:** User dashboard page would crash for students with job offers  
**Fix:** Added database query to fetch job offers at the beginning of the file  
**Location:** `user/user-dashboard.php` (Lines 20-35)

#### 2. ✅ Missing `script.js` File
**Issue:** Referenced in multiple files but didn't exist, causing JavaScript errors  
**Impact:** Form submissions and interactive features wouldn't work properly  
**Fix:** Created `script.js` with common functionality for form handling and smooth scrolling  
**Location:** `script.js` (New file created)

#### 3. ✅ Missing `students.js` File
**Issue:** Referenced in students.php but didn't exist  
**Impact:** Students page specific features wouldn't load  
**Fix:** Created `students.js` file  
**Location:** `students.js` (New file created)

#### 4. ✅ Broken Image Path in header.php
**Issue:** Line 69 referenced `/inclusify/images/logo.png` which doesn't exist  
**Impact:** Logo wouldn't display for non-logged-in users  
**Fix:** Changed path to `/inclusify/logo.png`  
**Location:** `includes/header.php` (Line 69)

#### 5. ✅ Broken Dashboard Link in profile.php
**Issue:** Line 237 used incorrect format `$user['role']/$user['role']-dashboard.php`  
**Impact:** Cancel button would redirect to invalid URL  
**Fix:** Implemented proper dashboard link logic based on user role  
**Location:** `profile.php` (Lines 237-252)

#### 6. ✅ Type Color Mismatch in apply.php
**Issue:** Used types like 'job', 'scholarship' but database only has 'employment', 'internship'  
**Impact:** Badge colors wouldn't display correctly  
**Fix:** Updated getTypeColor() function to include both old and new types  
**Location:** `apply.php` (Lines 308-318)

#### 7. ✅ Missing `api_stats.php` File
**Issue:** Referenced in index.php but didn't exist

### **MINOR ISSUES (FIXED):**

#### 8. ✅ Redundant onclick Handlers in students.php
**Issue:** Lines 65-66 had onclick handlers when href was already present  
**Impact:** Unnecessary code, potential double navigation  
**Fix:** Removed onclick attributes  
**Location:** `students.php` (Lines 65-66, 145-146)

#### 9. ✅ Incomplete HTML Structure in signup.php
**Issue:** File closed without proper body/html tags before script section  
**Impact:** Invalid HTML structure  
**Fix:** Added closing body and html tags before script section  
**Location:** `signup.php` (Lines 526-527)

### **MINOR ISSUES (DOCUMENTED - NO ACTION NEEDED):**

#### 10. ℹ️ Brand Naming Inconsistency
**Issue:** Mix of "Awasar Nepal" and "Inclusify" throughout codebase  
**Impact:** Minor branding confusion  
**Note:** This appears intentional - "Avsar Nepal" is the public brand name, "Inclusify" is the internal project/database name  
**No fix applied** - seems to be by design

#### 11. ℹ️ Dead Footer Links
**Issue:** Footer links point to "#" anchors  
**Impact:** Links don't lead anywhere  
**Note:** Common for template pages - should be updated when actual pages are created  
**No fix applied** - will be updated when pages are built

**Location:** `signup.php` (Lines 526-527)

#### 10. ‚úÖ Poor Navigation Bar Usability
**Issue:** Navigation bar had multiple usability problems:
- Using `.container` instead of `.container-fluid` causing cramped spacing
- Too many links cluttering the navbar for student users
- No visual feedback for active page
- No profile picture display
- Brand name inconsistently shown
**Impact:** Poor user experience, cluttered interface, no visual navigation cues  
**Fix:** Complete navbar redesign with:

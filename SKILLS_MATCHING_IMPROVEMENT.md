2+ years experience"
```

### **2. Student Has Skills**
```
Student skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 🎨 UI Components

### **1. Skills Search Input**
```
Type: "Python" 
Dropdown shows:
  • Python ✓
  • PyTorch
```

### **2. Skills Container**
```
[Python] [JavaScript] [React] [Node.js]
   ×         ×            ×        ×
```

### **3. Additional Requirements**
```
[Text area for non-skill requirements]
Example: "2+ years experience, Bachelor's degree in CS"
```

---

## 💡 Benefits for Job Matching

### **1. Exact Matching**
```
Job Requires: "Python, JavaScript"
Student Has: "Python, JavaScript, HTML"

Match: 2 skills → Shows as "2 skills match" ✓
```

### **2. No False Positives**
```
OLD WAY:
Job: "Experience with Python scripts"
Student: "Python" 
Match: ✓ (Good!)

Job: "2+ years experience required"
Student: "Python"
Match: ❌ (Matched "experience" keyword - Bad!)

NEW WAY:
Skills field only contains actual skills
Matching is accurate ✓
```

### **3. Better Recommendations**
```
Skills are standardized:
- "JavaScript" not "javascript" or "JS"
- "React" not "react" or "ReactJS"
- "Python" not "python" or "Py"

Result: More accurate matching!
```

## 📊 Matching Algorithm Flow

```
EMPLOYER POSTS:
requirements = "Python, JavaScript, React

2+ years experience"

STUDENT HAS:
skills = "Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS"

ALGORITHM:
1. Split requirements: ["Python", "JavaScript", "React"]
2. Split student skills: ["Python", "JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"]
3. Check each student skill:
   - "Python" in requirements? → YES ✓
   - "JavaScript" in requirements? → YES ✓
   - "HTML" in requirements? → NO
   - "CSS" in requirements? → NO
4. Match Score: 2 out of 4 skills match
5. Show in recommendations if score > 0
6. Display: "2 skills match" badge
```
